## Preview Service

If you would like to try the project without self-hosting it, head over to [minilink.imalek.me](https://minilink.imalek.me).


## Installation

miniLink can be self-hosted in x easy steps:

1. **Install Docker**

   The preferred way to run miniLink is through Docker Compose. You can install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
   You can also just build the miniLink "backend" image and use it however you'd like.


2. **Clone down the repository**

   You want to download all the code from the repository. This can be done either by using the `git` CLI app, or with the "Download Zip" button.
   `git clone https://github.com/barealek/miniLink`


3. **Set up environment variables**

   miniLink requires a few environment variables to work. This includes the database connection string, (optionally) cloudflare tunnel


## Configuration

### Flags

When calling `zoxide init`, the following flags are available:

- `--cmd`
  - Changes the prefix of the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - `--cmd j` would change the commands to (`j`, `ji`).
  - `--cmd cd` would replace the `cd` command (doesn't work on Nushell / POSIX shells).
- `--hook <HOOK>`
  - Changes how often zoxide increments a directory's score:
    | Hook     | Description                       |
    | -------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `none`   | Never                             |
    | `prompt` | At every shell prompt             |
    | `pwd`    | Whenever the directory is changed |
- `--no-cmd`
  - Prevents zoxide from defining the `z` and `zi` commands.
  - These functions will still be available in your shell as `__zoxide_z` and
    `__zoxide_zi`, should you choose to redefine them.

### Environment variables

Environment variables[^2] can be used for configuration. They must be set before
`zoxide init` is called.
