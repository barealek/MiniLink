## Preview Service

If you would like to try the project without self-hosting it, head over to [minilink.imalek.me](https://minilink.imalek.me).


## Installation

miniLink can be self-hosted in x easy steps:

1. **Install Docker**

   The preferred way to run miniLink is through Docker Compose. You can install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/).
   You can also just build the miniLink "backend" image and use it however you'd like.


2. **Clone down the repository**

   You want to download all the code from the repository. This can be done either by using the `git` CLI app, or with the "Download Zip" button.
   `git clone https://github.com/barealek/miniLink`


3. **Set up environment variables**

   miniLink requires a few environment variables to work. This includes the database connection string, and (optionally) cloudflare tunnel token.

4. **Run the project**
   Lastly, you can run `docker compose up` to start the project. The first time it will take a minute or so to build.


Note: miniLink uses Cloudflared to expose the app - this isn't required, but it was the easiest way for me to deploy it.
